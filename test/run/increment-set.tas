# var has an initial value of zero. However, because it is a *symbol*, it can
# take only one final value per file. This is not documented elsewhere, and is
# somewhat confusing behavior. It would be nice to have some kind of "local
# variable" that could take on different values throughout a file.
.set var, 0

# Here @var will have whatever final value it acquires at the end of compilation.
b <- b + @var

# Incrementing the value in @var does have an effect, but not a
# *temporally-observable* one. Only the final state of @var is observable.
.set var, (@var + 1)
b <- b + @var

.set var, (@var + 1)
b <- b + @var
