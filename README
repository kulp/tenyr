tenyr aspires to be a complete 32-bit computing environment (simulated
architecture, operating system, compiler, utilities). It is very much a work in
progress. An assembler / disassembler (tas) and simulator / debugger (tsim)
exist, a Forth implementation is in its infancy, and the toycen compiler
project from https://github.com/kulp/toycen will probably supply the C compiler
component when it can generate code at all.

To build tenyr, both flex and bison are required.  Bison needs to be version 2.5;
bison 2.4.x will not work.
