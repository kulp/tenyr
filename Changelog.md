- `@+var` and `@=var` shorthand forms
- tests for op types 0, 1, and 2
- new Verilog module for VGA output

### Changed
- running recipes in the order they are specified, instead of reverse order
- allowing simulations to continue in the face of device errors
- restoring serial input functionality in a limited way
- changing VGA output to be 64x32 text columns (down from 80x40)

### Fixed
- correcting reported column numbers for syntax errors

### Removed
- third-party VHDL for VGA

## [0.9.4] - 2017-05-04
